ink beginner guide
This is a much more hand-held than the advanced guide. Hopefully you won't need it after the IGA class, but it doesn't hurt to have a refresher!

ink advanced guide
I tend to find that this is helpful for skimming through. You shouldn't memorize everything, but this is still super helpful for finding help on specific topics (like conditional choices).

Custom Tags

These tags are custom made by IGA to allow for ink to act a little more like a visual novel or dating sim.
Be sure to include the custom components on the game object that has your StoryManager!
You can easily add the components by right-clicking on the StoryManager component and clicking "Add Basic Tag Handlers."
You can use these tags by writing something like this above one of your lines of text:
#SetImage Portrait Characters/Boy/Smiling1
For images and sounds to be accessible by these tags, they need to be included in your game's /Resources/ folder and have no spaces in the file's name or in one of the folder's names!
For example, if you want to reference an image at "/Resources/Images/Backgrounds/SunnyDay.png", then you would reference the image by writing "Images/Backgrounds/SunnyDay". Be sure to remove the "Resources" folder at the front as well as the file extension!

SetImage takes 2 arguments:
#SetImage <name of game object in the scene that has an Image component> <reference to image file>
It replaces an image's sprite and makes it visible.
Examples:
- #SetImage LeftPortrait Cindy/Crying1
- #SetImage LocationIcon Locations/Boston

ClearImage takes 1 argument:
#ClearImage <name of game object in the scene that has an Image component>
It makes an image hidden.
Examples:
- #ClearImage LeftPortrait
- #ClearImage LocationIcon

PlaySound takes 2 arguments:
#PlaySound <name of game object in the scene that has an AudioSource component> <reference to audio clip file>
It plays a sound through the given audio source (so you can configure the audio source to change the pitch/volume etc.).
Examples:
- #PlaySound Music Music/SleepTimeSong
- #PlaySound Voice VoiceLines/Sam/HeyHowAreYou

StopSound takes 1 argument:
#StopSound <name of game object in the scene that has an AudioSource component>
It stops all sounds coming from that audio source.
Examples:
- StopSound Music
- StopSound Voice

Bonus syntax: If you have a Speaker text referenced in your StoryManager, you can designate a speaker with each line of text using a colon, like so:
Willem: Why hello there, it is I: Willem the wizard! How'de do?
If you don't want there to be a speaker but you still want to have a colon in the text, you can abuse the syntax like so:
:Suddenly, you notice an object in the room: an unreasonably-large wizard hat of many, many colors.
